                    I provide consulting and design services for software systems and applications. On this page is the usual basic information along with some personal observations on software engineering in general. On the Case Studies page are several anecdotal capsules describing real world approaches to real world problems.

                        <h2>The Reality Of Software</h2>
                        <p>
                        The reality is that most software projects are not clean sheet designs but consist of adding to or modifying an existing package. Since some of these can be quite ancient (how about a 30+ year old Fortran application running on a dedicated F77 emulator!) they tend to have accumulated a lot of cruft. Quite often there is naught to be done to save the patient and a full re-write is the only effective and efficient way forward. However in many other cases, careful rearchitecting, refactoring and retrofitting can revitalize the application without disrupting the core codebase. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Other Reality Of Software</h2>
                        <p>
                        Most software is overly complex - Occam's razor must be a guiding principle. Many systems are designed by following certain patterns and models too rigorously and not taking a more "holistic" view. Compare Boost with the standard Qt libraries: the former is an unintelligible PhD dissertation, the latter an elegant and clean solution with consistent APIs. And then there's  the whole JavaScript web ecosystem - open source from the dark side. Just ask

                        <p>
                        The software is only one part of an overall system. In order to ensure successful outcomes, the full lifecycle must be considered:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Accurate requirements gathering and management, and traceability to...</li>
                        <li>Specification of architecture and design and...</li>
                        <li>Testing in myriad forms: unit, integration, verification, validation, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        All of which must be properly documented (but automate the drudgery as much as possible!).

                        <h2>Testing</h2>
                        <p>
                        Too often in the hurry to design and implement, testing is not given its due attention, with inevitable long-term pains. Ideally the application should be designed for testability from the start, however good results can be had post hoc by adding appropriate interfaces enabling the use of external tools to actually drive the test cases. This is particularly true for embedded systems which are notoriously difficult to unit test.
